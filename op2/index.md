## Consumer Power for Sustainability

# We all care
![][earth]
Most people look at the world around them and see things they really would like to change. We care about how our society is organised, we care about the well-being of our friends and family and we care about future of the planet at large. When we see things that threaten the things we care about we want to do something about it.

Many of us are willing to make trade-offs and sacrifices to protect the things they care about. We are willing to give generously our time and energy to develop strategies, to share insights and beliefs, inform and educate others.

This willingness to take positive action is not confined to a small number of idealists. Given a realistic chance of having an impact, we are all activists to some degree.

# We all care, but we care differently.

Reasonable people can, and do, disagree on which **areas** are the most important to focus on from a sustainability standpoint.  In many of these areas, reasonable people can, and do, disagree about the **strategies** and **measures** required to address the challenges.

![][tagcloud]

For example, even those who agree that Energy is a critical area might have diametrically opposed ideas on which energy sources or conservation strategies that are the most effective. Some argue that the biggest threat is Climate Change and that our best bet to combat it is to expand the use of Nuclear Power, others argue that Nuclear waste is even more dangerous than Global Warming.

Some people very deliberately avoid buying products made in Myanmar because they feel that doing so would be an economic endorsement of the Military Junta. Others feel that it is more important to help boost the economy in that impoverished country by supporting the textile industry.

These are just a couple of examples of when caring people disagree on what is important or how to best meet a sustainability challenge. A central principle of Earthsen.se is that we do not takes sides on these questions but instead we allow each member to participate from her point of view.

# Our dollars at work for our values

Affecting global change through our political institutions requires consensus, and political consensus is a very elusive thing. Even if consensus can be reached on the local or national level, affecting *global* issues requires *global* consensus — an even more elusive goal.

![][purchase]
The problem of affecting change through policy is compounded by economic globalization. When policy measures that trades sustainability for profitability are implemented locally, economic activity and the flow of capital is immediately redirected to circumvent the measures.

Meanwhile, we as individuals actually are in control of economic power that cannot be circumvented. Whatever our values and priorities, our most powerful way of supporting them is by consistently selecting products and services that are produced and sold in a way that is consistent with our values. And *because* of globalization, this power is applied globally.

A purchase is a powerful endorsement. It’s an ultimate stamp of approval on the product, the brand and the value chain that produced it. We should use this power very deliberately and wisely.

# The problem
So clearly the best way to affect change is to exercise our power as consumers — to vote with our wallets. Yet so many of us buy products everyday that are produced in a way that runs directly counter to our beliefs. Why? How come we are frustrated by the rise of businesses and countries that succeed by systematically exploiting and destroying things we care about, yet we lend them our support by buying the goods and services they produce.

![][connect1]

The key barrier to our ability to exercise our Consumer Power is the lack of information. We all inadvertently support Regimes, Companies, Substances, Products and Practices that work against our core beliefs because we don’t know how the goods we buy have been produced. The information is either unavailable or very hard to find.

We also lack an effective channel to influence others about the products that should be favoured or avoided from the standpoint of our value system.

# **earthsen.se**

**earthsen.se** solves the information deficit by pulling together everything caring people collectively know about the sustainability aspects of Companies, Brands and Products into an instantly searchable data set and a meritocratic community dedicated to curating and evolving it.

![][connect2]
**earthsen.se** provides a convenient way of connecting products and services with the areas and priorities that make up our value system. We frequently have to make buying decisions quickly and need a solution that provides this information instantly and accurately at the point of sale. The **earthsen.se** mobile app gives us instant access to the collective knowledge about the product by simply scanning a barcode or a lightning-fast search of the database.

**earthsen.se** allows us to quickly find and discover the products and services that match our values and priorities.
- Lightning-fast personalised search that will rank the Products, Brands and Companies match your values (EarthPrint).
- Intelligent recommendation of related product and services you might like.
- Get pointers and opinions from other site members through the many conversational features of the site (comments and forums).
**earthsen.se** make this possible by also engaging us to contribute our insights to the community. Businesses are invited to contribute as well, but all information is vetted by the community and no advertising will ever make its way into the database.

## EarthPrint - an online expression of our value system

We all care differently. Therefore, **earthsen.se** doesn’t require you to buy into an existing, predefined value system. Instead, **earthsen.se** allows you to define your own — the *EarthPrint*. By selecting the areas we care about and by ranking the aspects that we believe contribute the most to a sustainable world, we are in fact creating our own, personalised **earthsen.se** view. All our search results, suggestions of products and content will be personalised with respect to our *EarthPrint*.

# Global Sustainability Reference Database

The mission of **earthsen.se** is to be the Sustainability Reference Database of the world. Ethical shoppers around the world will use **earthsen.se** to help each other make informed purchase decisions and collectively maximise their power as consumers to effect change.

![][data-diagram]

## Seeding the data set

The data set is seeded from three primary sources.
- **Global Trade Databases.** These are the issuers of the UPC (Universal Product Code) and its cousin standards, which is the barcode you see on pretty much any product in a retail store.
- **Intellectual Property Databases.** These databases are the main resources for patent and trademark-related data and contain information about Brands and Brand Owners along with associated Symbols (logos) , etc.
- **Global and local Business Directories** provides the most up-to-date information about office locations and contact information.


## Business and Partner Participation

Stores and Brand Owners can connect to the service using our published HTTP/JSON api. They have an opportunity to curate their business presentation and the factual information that might form the basis for their **earthsen.se** rating. **They cannot influence the ratings themselves. **

Partners and Affiliates such as Eco-labels and environmental organisations can also hook into the **earthsen.se** api, allowing us to feature the certification status they have on file as a part of the product, brand or company profile.

As a result, **earthsen.se** understands the ecosystem from which the product or brand emanated.

# supply chain Transparency

*What is the connection between the candy we buy in the grocery store and the destruction of the of Sumatran rainforest?* To understand this we need to understand that the production of the candy requires Palm Oil which in turn has disastrous consequences for the environment in the countries from where it’s imported.

To make these connections we need to understand the supply chains that produce the end product we buy.

At the start of every value chain is a number of **resources**, such as raw materials, produce, minerals, meats, grains and seafood. In **earthsen.se** we rate resources as well as the products produced further down the value chain.

**earthsen.se** models the supplier relationships between the participants in the ecosystem forming a graph connecting the sourcing of **resources** through all the manufacturing and assembly or other refinement activities all the way to the customer. The companies can provide and maintain information about their ecosystem neighbourhood themselves but the information us vetted by the **earthsen.se** community. New supplier relationships can be created by members on the site along with a justification of the claim, in much the same way as ratings are added. Supplier relationship information is reinforced by upvotes and are eligible for *CredPoint* accrual.

Sustainability information can now be aggregated from resources all the way to the end-product through the supply chain, and the supply chain information can be navigated by following the supplier / customer links between companies.

## Sustainability disclosure and reporting

This also gives business a way to nominate and showcase their best suppliers in very much the same way as one would connect in social media. Businesses can use **earthsen.se** to account for and communicate their sustainability structure including their extended ecosystem.

# Social Sharing
![][social]
It’s in human nature to want to share knowledge and influence others to align with the issues we care about. **earthsen.se** helps us express and share our perspective on sustainability. Some of us will also engage actively in the community and receive tangible recognition for our important contribution in the form of our reputation score, and the Badges and Awards that the community might decide to bestow upon its members.

- Social Media extends the reach of the community to include pretty much every internet user.
- It serves as a powerful recruitment vehicle for the community.
- It provides an enormous wall of *fame*, or *shame*, as the case may be, for resources, businesses, products and brands.

Community members are working for their individual causes and the system helps them reach out to their network and maximize the impact of their involvement, using social media to assign praise or disgrace where it is due, to keep their social circle abreast of their activities and preferences and to recruit others to the cause.

# Specifying our EarthPrint
![][earthprint]
We care about different aspects of sustainability. **earthsen.se** allows you to specify the aspects that you care about and their relative importance. **earthsen.se** uses this information to rank search results and select the most relevant products, brands, companies and content for us.

As a registered members we can select the rating factors we care about from the list of the defined factors. The factors we select get a total of 100 weighting points to be distributed among them. For each of the specified factors we can allocate a weighting 1 \>= X \<= 100 indicating the relative importance of the factor. The system makes sure that the average weighting across all selected aspects will always be 50. When we increase the importance of an aspect, the importance of all the other weightings are decreased. Consequently, as we increase the importance of an aspect, the other aspects are reduced such that the average remains 50.

The result is that we now have a personalised index into the **earthsen.se** database. Our entire **earthsen.se** experience including search results, news and top-lists, product and content suggestions, etc., will be tailored based on our sustainability profile.

# On the web
![][web]
The sleek web interface is where we manage our EarthSenze engagement, write reviews, and to more in-depth research.
Anonymous users can search the database and get search results and content suggestions based on the default ranking. Logged in Members get the personalised experience made possible by the *EarthPrint* and can also participate in the community, submit ratings, comments, forum posts, etc.

# On the Go
![][go]
**earthsen.se** doesn’t just help us when shopping online. An important component is to help guide us to brick-and-mortar retailers that carry products and brands that are compatible with our value system.

## Geolocation Information
One way in which **earthsen.se** guides in the physical world is by providing a map view of search results. We plot a search result on a map based on a location — or current location or some other location where we plan to go shopping.

## Opt-in Location-aware Notifications

For maximum serendipity, we can opt in to have **earthsen.se** notify us when we get geographically close to a store that carries some product that we are shopping for. As we get within some configurable radius of a highly ranked store, or one that carries Brands and Products of the type we are shopping for that ranks highly in our EarthPrint, we get a notification. The notification includes links to the item as well as a Map location to the store.

# In the store
![][store]
Once in the store, we need very quick and convenient access to the information a product we’re considering. Researching a purchase at the point of sale is a snap.

Almost all products carry a unique ID - The Universal Product Code (UPC). Just point your smart-phone camera at the UPC barcode or QR code on an item you are considering purchasing and immediately get the information about the item, along with its score relative to your own EarthPrint.

To search for specific Brands, Companies, Stores for which there is no UPC, the free text search field is backed by an ultra quick autocomplete function. The search can be further constrained by your geographical location.

## iBeacon network
**earthsen.se** provides an iBeacon-based solution for retailers that will allow members to get notified about specific product that fits our criteria and to guide customers directly to the department or even the shelf where it can be found.

# Big Data. Big Opportunity
![][big-data]
The **earthsen.se** sustainability database is a treasure trove for Big Data processing and insight. It is a truly huge data set which makes it a Perfect domain for Deep Learning. In addition, a very large portion of the data is categorized and tagged which aids in the training of machine learning algorithms.

## Personalization and Recommendation Systems

In **earthsen.se**, personalization is key. The whole experience is tailored to our own preference using our EarthPrint profile. The large amounts of curated, rated and tagged data allows us to train a Deep Learning system to recognize and associate products, brands and information. This information is used extensively to bring the most relevant content to the surface for each user, and allow navigation of the dataset along these dimensions of commonality.

### Sustainability Dashboard
Sustainability is an increasingly important factor in Brand preference. By making this information readily available to consumers as they are making their purchase decisions, **earthsen.se** helps making it one of the most important criteria, making it a priority for Companies and Brand Managers to adopt sustainable practices and to articulate and effectively communicate this strategy and follow up the results.

### Brand Sentiment Analysis

**earthsen.se** data provides the basis for a unique brand sentiment analysis with respect to sustainability. The Brand Analysis Dashboard gives companies a powerful tool to manage and measure the actual impact of their sustainability strategies. **earthsen.se** also mashes up the rating data and conversations with other Social Media streams och as Twitter and Facebook creating a consolidated, near real-time picture across the social media landscape.

The dashboard can be set up to:
- Detect the sustainability areas and aspects that matter the most to the market
- Track trends in key metrics over time.
- Determine the channels that have the greatest impact.
- Gauge effectiveness of specific programs and campaigns.
- Compare to category leaders and average.
- Identify aspects that need attention.

# Anatomy of the Community
![][community]
The community is the engine and soul of **earthsen.se**. We think of **earthsen.se** as a seed that will be turned over to the community to be cultivated and flourish.

## Meritocratic
The quality and integrity and the data, as well as the organization of the community behind it, is managed by the community itself. Many successful sites such as Wikipedia, Quora, StackOverflow (et.Al.) use user feedback to rank content and other members, thereby achieving some measure of self-regulation. **earthsen.se** borrows liberally from the success of these sites but adds its own specialized mechanisms to further guarantee the integrity of the community.

## EarthCred - The **earthsen.se** Reputation System
The Reputation System identifies members that are trustworthy, competent and that adds value to the community. The Reputation is denominated in *EarthCred*, a Smart Token based on crypto currency minted specifically for the EarthSenze *EarthCred* reputation system.

*EarthCred* Initially EarthCreds are earned according to the following schedule.
1. By providing a ranking along with a justification that reaches the threshold level of upvotes (initially 100)
2. By writing a discussion post that reaches the threshold level of upvotes (initially 50)
3. The system for awarding *EarthCreds* to members is highly flexible.
The principles for the accrual of *EarthCreds* can be managed by the community
The authority associated with reaching certain *EarthCreds* levels can be managed by the community

## Self-Organizing
The Community collectively ensures that the data in the network is relevant, authentic, spam-free , etc., through the authority system. The Authority system grants individual members the power to flag content all the way to actually altering or removing content, depending on the *EarthCred* of the member.

A sample of the *Authorities* that will initially be supported along with the required *EarthCred*:
- 1000 trusted user Expanded editing, deletion and undeletion privileges
- 200 edit comments and justifications Edits to any comments or justifications are applied immediately
- 150 resolve add-nominations Settle nominations from members of brands and products to be added.
- 100 vote down Indicate when a rating or content is not useful
- 50 write comments Leave comments on other people's posts
- 15 flag content Bring to the attention of the community
- 10 vote up Indicate when questions and answers are useful
- 1 create a rating
The initial credpoint is earned when reading the getting started guide.

## Autonomous
**earthsen.se** takes the idea of Self-organization one step further by making the community responsible for evolving itself. The starting point are a set of bylaws and a highly customisable content and member ranking system. The bylaws serve as a kind of constitution for the community, but the whole system is then turned over to the community to manage independently. The constitution itself can be amended and even changed by to community provided that a very high degree of consensus has been reached.

# Rating Products and Brands
![][rating]
A guiding principle of the **earthsen.se** rating model is simplicity. It provides precisely the mechanisms required to allow the community to regulate itself.

## Ratings
In order to rank a product or a brand, a member provides three things:
- An aspect to which the ranking pertains such as Co2, Fair Trade, etc…
- A rank (1-6).
- A written justification (1-2 paragraphs)
Ratings contribute to the overall rating of the item based on its weight. Initially a rating will have a weight of 1. Other members can choose to upvote a rating giving it additional weight and increasing its influence on the overall rating.

# Business Model
**earthsen.se** is performing a vital role in allowing business and consumers who care about sustainability to come together in the market. This may seem like a charitable role, but in order to fulfil it **earthsen.se** needs to be a business. Sustainability should be profitable, that’s a core principal.

## Monetizing Data
At the heart of the **earthsen.se** system is the treasure trove of information gathered and carefully curated by the ecosystem consisting of the member community and participating businesses. The monetising options around the database are similar to those used by sites such as [Tripadvisor](http://tripadvisor.com "Visit Tripadvisor") who like **earthsen.se** build their business around a crowd-sourced, highly reputable database of opinions, ratings and reviews.

Part of the business  **earthsen.se** model is to offer sustainability Management tools for Business and Brand Owners. We offer a premium model for business accounts, where the ability to manage the presentation materials and business listing is free. The database allows businesses to gain unique insight into how their products and brands rank and the effectiveness of measures. The subscription product consists of a set of powerful analysis tools for ongoing management and analysis of the sustainability aspects of the business.

## Monetising Traffic
Another cornerstone of the business model is *lead referrals* to participating businesses. For each product our brand that shows up in a suggestion box or a search result, there will optionally be a link to a list of online stores that carry the product. For logged in members these will be ranked by proximity to the home address or by preference (and based on past behaviour), in other cases they will be ranked based on their sustainability score in **earthsen.se**. Our model is a pay for action model where we measure clicks on links to products.

### Referrals
**earthsen.se** negotiates referral agreements with top-tier retailers for lead sales. An adaptable architecture is provided to track and clear referrals against retailers with existing referral systems and APIs. In addition, **earthsen.se** includes a tracking system for retailers who lack a system of their own or who prefer to use it.

### Affiliate system
For the long tail of retailers, **earthsen.se**  enrols in as many affiliate programs as possible, either directly or through affiliate brokers.

In order to safeguard the integrity of the site, it will never be possible to buy search rankings or sponsored links. All search results and product suggestions will be based on community-generated ratings and reviews paired with the earth print of the individual member which is used to provide an individualised experience.

# Conclusion

We all care about a number of issues, be they the health of the planet, the eradication of poverty, for freedom and democracy, etc. We differ in terms the issues we care about and their relative priority. We also have different, and sometimes diametrically opposed, ideas on how these issues are best addressed.

We have the power to change our consumption patterns to promote the issues we care about, but we rarely exercise this power. What are the critical, missing enablers that would make this happen — that would allow us to unleash our global power as consumers and to influence the world in the direction consistent with our *personal* value system?

The missing tool is convenient and immediate access to the information we need to guide the purchase decision every day, personalized for us as individuals based on our priorities.

This is an uncovered space on the internet and **earthsen.se** if laser-focused on solving this problem and take this position.

We can obviously not rely on the industry or governments to provide this information in an unbiased way. We tap into official product and brand databases to seed the database with the basic data. Business- and brand owners will be able to provide factual information about their business, products, supply chain, sustainability strategies etc, and this information will be cleansed from spin and non-factual information by the community. But the heart of **earthsen.se** is a global self-regulating community responsible for enhancing, expanding and curating this data to create *the* global sustainability reference database.

**earthsen.se** allows us all to contribute and work to improve the world from our own personal standpoints, without dogma, political correctness, special-interest agendas or preconceived notions.
