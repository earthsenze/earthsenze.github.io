"We care about how our society is organised, we care about the well-being of our friends and family and we care about future of the planet at large. When we see things that threaten the things we care about we want to do something about it."

"Reasonable people can, and do, disagree on which areas are the most important to focus on from a sustainability standpoint. In many of these areas, reasonable people can, and do, disagree about the strategies and measures required to address the challenges."

"The problem of affecting change through policy is compounded by economic globalization. When policy measures that trades sustainability for profitability are implemented locally, economic activity and the flow of capital is immediately redirected to circumvent the measures."

*"The problem is connecting our possible product choices with the parameters that we care about. To exercise our consumer power we need to make this connection quickly and conveniently. "*
